# TI4 Franken Draft

A React application for drafting custom Twilight Imperium 4 factions using the Franken Draft format. Supports both solo and multiplayer(eventually) drafting.

## Quick Setup

**Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
### Solo Draft Mode
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

- **Franken**: Each player gets a bag of components, picks items, then passes bags
- **Rotisserie**: All components in shared pools, players pick in turn order
- **Power**: Like Franken but with higher component limits

## Key Features

- Real-time multiplayer via Firebase (unavailable)
- Faction theorycrafting mode
- Draft history tracking
- Component search and filtering
- Tile resource/influence calculations (semi-working)

## Adding/Fixing soon

- Creating custom Non-Draft Components
- Adding DS as an optional/standalone (in progress)
- Adding US as an optional/standalone (in progress)
- Make expansion content able to be separated.
- Add Thunders Edge stuff once Luminous works out how to implement into franken (~month after release)
- Make draft actually start with local multiayer

## Eventual Non-Franken features to add

- Faction Reference
- Lore Reference
- Milty Draft
